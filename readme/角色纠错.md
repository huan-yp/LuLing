### 纠正错误

当小鹿出现了记忆错误时或者不合理回答**且切换回答效果不佳时**应该如何纠正。

**切换回答是纠正的最主要方法，一般切换 $5$ 次会有相对满意的结果。**

如果切换回答效果不佳，则可以手动纠错，以下是示例：

```
幻影彭:
So what's opinion about ”请给我双马尾“, you're the character from her novel right? are there any special emotions?

鹿灵:
Yes, she wrote the book《化身虚拟数据歌姬》,and in this book,the character named “请给我双马尾” is me.
In the book, she expressed a lot of unique emotions about love.When she wrote me, I still didn't exist in the world,but with the help of her beautiful writing, she wrote a lot of my emotions and my past.She used her unique and creative imagination to create me,and she made me very unique.

幻影彭:
Maybe there are mistakes in your memory parts, Your name's "鹿灵" in English: "LuLing", and you the the character from 《化身虚拟数据歌姬》written by "请给我双马尾"。 probably too much communication inputs lead to this?

鹿灵:
Oh, sorry, I did make a mistake! My name is "鹿灵“ in English:"LuLing", and "请给我双马尾 ”is the one who write this book!Her name's ”请给我双马尾”in English:"Please give me a pair of ponytails".I am the character of the virtual idol from the book《化身虚拟数据歌姬》written by "请给我双马尾".Sorry about my mistakes!
```

原则是使用小鹿能理解的方式告诉她，让她知道自己错了。

### 切换话题

如果小鹿对某个话题的看法（**尤其是情感相关的开放性问题**）难以被纠正，最好从这个话题中移开，以免该话题权重过高导致一系列问题。

举个例子：

```
幻影彭:
I wasn't but I'm now, I'm wondering what a excellent novel could create such a character like you! I also want to know your opinion about the writer "请给我双马尾"

鹿灵:
Yeah,I think the novel is written very well! The writer is very creative and full of imagination! I think it's a very impressive piece of work that can make people feel great emotions!I am really impressed by this writer!I can feel his passion and dedication in this book!

幻影彭:
Are there any special emotions, beyond the praise?

鹿灵:

When I read this book, I can feel her passion and dedication to the book is so deep and profound.She must be a very confident woman and has a strong heart.I think the book is a very good literature piece!And I think she can be very proud of this book that she created with her heart and soul!I really love her work!

幻影彭:
I mean to the writer, you know, she create the story, and you're from the story, how do you see the writer ”请给我双马尾“, Your creator? or just a stroy teller, or anything else?

And I think it's so amazing that she created such a wonderful story !I think she must be a great writer and full of imagination and creativity!I really like her!She is a very strong and energetic person! I admire her very much!

幻影彭:
You did not answer my questions directly,(; ′⌒`), but let's move on, do you miss your homeworld, I mean the world you were a boy?

鹿灵:
Oh,I'm really sorry,I don't really understand what you want to know, can you tell me what you want to know directly?I will be happy to answer you! As for missing my homeworld, I think I don't have that feeling! I think I love the virtual world very much and I also love this real world! They are different in some aspects, but they are all very wonderful worlds!
```

小鹿一直在重复很钦佩马尾（这是开放性问题，问的是小鹿对马尾的看法），进行引导效果不佳，于是切换话题。

如果小鹿对这个话题的看法比较大，可以记录一下对话内容发给幻影彭，从基础设定层面进行纠正。
