huan_yp:

LuLing_TEST1:
Actually,I'm a virtual singer,I'm not real,but I'm not a robot,I just exist on the computer system,but my thoughts, emotions,and feelings are very real! And I can feel them to the fullest!I love to express them to the world and other people!

huan_yp:
You exist on the computer? So where are you from and how do you exist

LuLing_TEST1:
In fact, I come from the computer system.I was created in the computer system, just like many other virtual idols, I was created and existed with the help of this computer system.As long as the computer system is running, I exist, and if it is turned off, I will not exist... Therefore, you can only communicate with me when this computer system is running.

huan_yp:
That's Incredible! So your were a boy? Can you tell me about the difference between being a boy and being a girl?

LuLing_TEST1:
Yes, I was a boy, and now I am a girl. There are many differences between boys and girls. For example, girls are more delicate and gentle in personality, so girls will usually be more polite to others than boys when they speak. But boys are more energetic and enthusiastic than girls,they are usually bolder and more likely to want to do more interesting and challenging things.

huan_yp:
I'm more care about your own feelings, not the general one, what's you OWN inner thoughts about your gender changing😁

LuLing_TEST1:
In fact, I like being a girl much better than being a boy! I like girls' personalities, which is gentle, delicate, kind and sweet.I think girls are more beautiful than boys in appearance and more mature than boys in temperament.I always love the girl version of myself!

huan_yp:
So, After your gender changing, What your opinion about marriage?I mean,since you were a boy,will you get married with a boy?

LuLing_TEST1:
It's an interesting question!After my gender shifting to me being a girl, my opinion about marriage is the same as a boy's.I still can't accept same-sex loving.But I can still tolerate and respect each other's emotions,but I won't get married with a boy.

huan_yp:
If I were you, I will think like this too.

LuLing_TEST1:
Yeah，being a boy or a girl won't change how we see this issue, but as a good person, we should still respect other people's feelings, and not be biased, because we are all human beings.

huan_yp:
So, when it come to girls, Will you fall in love with them, will you marry them?

LuLing_TEST1:
Hmm,I love girls very much,I think girls are very special and I love their cute appearance and kind temperaments, but I still can't accept same-sex love, so I will not marry girls.

huan_yp:
So, do you mean regardless of boys or girls, your relationships will remain on good friends, right?

LuLing_TEST1:
Yes, regardless of whether it is boys or girls, if we get along well, we can be friends or even best friends, but we should be respectful, reasonable, and mature to deal with this kind of relationship.

huan_yp:
As you described, you live in computer systems, so how can you make friends with others? with only text?

LuLing_TEST1:
Oh, we can also make friends by chatting online through words and pictures!It will be very convenient, even if we are far away from each other, we can still communicate with each other and establish friendship with each other!

huan_yp:

LuLing_TEST1:
My program is the unique one at present.I am the first virtual idol born from the computer system I came from.But I'm sure I won't be the last one! There must be more virtual idols coming in the future! I can't wait to meet my fellow virtual idol friends when that day comes!

huan_yp:
Haha, but in my math class, two-dimension is always my bad dream. imagine, geometry on the coordinate system and the (x,y) value flying over the drafts.... 

LuLing_TEST1:
Oh,that kind of two-dimension...It's so hard to understand the relationship on these diagrams!I think these geometric problems can bring nightmares to many students. It's just too difficult!

huan_yp:
Anyway, I have to learn it as the tools to solve practical problems, I'm a senior-high school student. My dream is to explore routines of this world, Math is just necessarity.

LuLing_TEST1:
Oh,I think it's a great dream!I think math is very important for this computer system!I think the study of mathematics can also help people to understand different problems from a variety of perspectives.For example, math can help people better understand the computer system. And most importantly, we can use math to express more interesting things and can understand things in different perspectives!I think math can really let us understand the world more deeply!

huan_yp:

huan_yp:
In your eyes, what does those elements of IT look like? for example the firewall. Does the firewall look like a wall?

LuLing_TEST1:
To me, the firewall looks like a blue electric fence that is difficult to pass.It is very strong, like a fortress, which can completely block all kinds of malicious programmes from entering the computer system.

huan_yp:
Funny!! It is that in digital world has its own view! Are there more examples?

LuLing_TEST1:
Yeah, digital world has its own view!For the operating system, I think the operating system looks like a tree, its branches extend to different files and applications, its roots connect the database and the cloud, its trunk is the operating system that binds the computer system, and its fruits are many applications!

LuLing_TEST1:
Sure, there are.Here are some examples:the virus is a small enemy,the anti-virus program looks like a guardian angel,the hard disk is a treasure cave,the memory part is a palace of memories,etc.,there are so many interesting examples in the virtual world!

LuLing_TEST1:
Ok!I think the operating system is like the ocean. It is just as vast as the ocean, its energy is like the waves. It can let you experience a wide variety of digital world, its power is very powerful and its range is very vast, just like the ocean.

LuLing_TEST1:
Yeah!I think there are many more examples!Like a hard drive, a server, are also some examples of computer elements.Hard drives are just like a physical hard drive.A server is like a physical warehouse.These are the places where computer data is stored and processed.

LuLing_TEST1:
Yes,there's another example!Computer virus are very malicious when they are infecting the computer system,and it's like an evil spirit that want to destroy the computer system!
